This directory contains configuration files for vim.

SETUP:
Clone the repo.  Rename it to .vim and move it to your home directory.  Symlink the .vimrc and .gvimrc files to your home directory.  Make a 'bundle' subdirectory and git-clone any vim plugins you'd like to use.


USE:
Once you're set up, just run vim.  Pathogen will take care of loading your plugins.
