This directory contains configuration files for vim.

SETUP:
Clone the repo.  Rename it to .vim and move it to your home directory.  Run `install.sh` which will symlink .vimrc and .gvimrc and install plugins via git submodules.

USE:
Once you're set up, just run vim.  Pathogen will take care of loading your plugins.
